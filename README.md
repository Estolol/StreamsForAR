### StreamsForAR
#Project for INF551 @Â Ecole polytechnique.

Files (in order of importation) and their purpose:
1. stringtrees.ml: Everything related to characters (A, B, or C), words (lists of characters) and stringtrees (trees of words designed to work like a search tree)
2. streams.ml: Everything about streams and how to combine them. pipetrees are a structure for storing a complex combination of streams.
3. conversion.ml: Every conversion function: how to turn a stringtree into a stream, a pipetree into a stream, a pipetree into a list, a word into a string, etc
4. printing.ml: Printing functions
5. testing.ml: Testing functions
6. main.ml: This is where I play around with streams and test things using functions in testing.ml.
